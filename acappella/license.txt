Acappella Dataset

The dataset contains ~ 46 hours of a cappella solo singing videos sourced from YouTube.
The dataset covers singing content in 4 language categories: English, Spanish, Hindi and others.
Besides, the singers also span a wide range of different ethnicities, accents, professions and ages.

The dataset comes with pre-defined splits:
~ 80 % Training, ~ 7% Validation, ~ 13% Test (seen-heard + unseen-unheard)

The samples in our dataset are defined based on the timestamps corresponding to the segments
of interest in each of the videos. We provide these timestamps as a part of the dataset.
They have been manually selected to exclude parts of the videos that do not satisfy any
of the following characteristics: single frontal face view without occlusions, minimal background
noise, no beatboxing, no snapping fingers, songs with lyrics (e.g. we avoid humming and yodelling).
We provide Youtube URLs, associated face detections, and timestamps, as well as cropped audio segments
and cropped face videos from the dataset. The copyright the of original videos remains
with the original owners of those videos.
